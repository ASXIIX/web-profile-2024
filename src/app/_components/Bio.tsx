      <div>
      I am interested in photography, web design and development, and in the future, 
      I may also learn to design and develop applications. During my time at Walailak University, 
      I served as the Vice President and Head of the Photography Department of the Art Photography 
      Club. I worked as a photographer for various events both within and outside the university. 
      This experience helped me develop communication skills, leadership skills, and enhanced 
      my photography skills.
